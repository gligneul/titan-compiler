# Titan benchmarks

This directory contains some bechmarks to compare Titan's execution time
with Lua and LuaJIT.

# Requirements for running the benchmarks

1. [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) >= 5.3.0
2. [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/) >= 2.0.5

# Usage

        $ lua run.lua

The benchmark script `run.lua` uses the Titan compiler `titanc` from the
parent directory.
